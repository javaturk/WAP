	Programming with Java 3.3 Examples</H1>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">In order for the examples to run correctly please
	make following changes to the project:</H3>

<H3>
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure that "srcDir", "jspDir", and ""web.xml" init parameters of the servlet <b>org.javaturk.wap.util.SourceCodeServlet</b> have the path of "src", "jsp" directories and "web.xml" file in their values, respectively. Only after making these changes would the "Source Code" links in the codes work.</li>
		<li>And read Readme.txt in jsp\ch08 to make some db configuration so that <b>leagues.jsp</b> work correctly.</li>
		<li>For org.javaturk.wap.ch10.LogFilter make sure that Java hasrights to create a file called log.txt in C:.</li>
		<li>Consider using a network motinor to understand what happens under the hood. For this purpose you can use browsers' tools such as Firebug on Firefox or Inspect of Chrome. Firebug is installed as a add-on and Inspect is available as right click on the page.</li>
