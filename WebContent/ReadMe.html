<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Read me for Web Application Programming with Java 4.0 Exampless</H1>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">In order for the examples to run correctly please
	make following changes to the project:</H3>

<H3>
		<p>
		Make sure that "srcDir", "jspDir", and ""web.xml" init parameters of the servlet <b>org.javaturk.wap.util.SourceCodeServlet</b> have the path of "src", "jsp" directories and "web.xml" file in their values, respectively. Only after making these changes would the "Source Code" links in the codes work.</li>
		<p>
		And read Readme.txt in jsp\ch08 to make some db configuration so that <b>leagues.jsp</b> work correctly.</li>
		<p>
		For org.javaturk.wap.ch10.LogFilter make sure that Java has rights to create a file called log.txt in C:.</li>
		<p>
		Consider using a network monitor to understand what happens under the hood. For this purpose you can use tools such as Firefox Developer Edition or Chrome Developer Tools. </li>
