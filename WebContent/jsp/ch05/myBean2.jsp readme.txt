jsp.ch05cmyBean2.jsp should access "mySerializedBean.ser" file. It works on Tomcat when the file is put
under "\WEB-INF\classes" of wap application. But for Eclipse-Tomcat I can't make it worked.
I tried to put the ser file into numerous places but to no avail.

To create "mySerializedBean.ser" file run wap.jsp.ch05.BeanSerializer.
